# Applied Statistical Modeling and Data Science Portfolio

## Overview
This repository is a collection of projects demonstrating how I use **statistics and data science** to solve real-world problems.  
Each subfolder contains a self-contained case study with code, documentation, and interpretations.  

The focus across these projects is on:
- Translating business or scientific questions into statistical models.  
- Applying regression, hypothesis testing, simulation, and inference.  
- Communicating results with clear visualizations and context.  
- Connecting statistical findings to actionable decisions.  

## How to Explore
Each project is organized in its own subfolder. Inside, you will find:
- A **README.md** describing the problem, methods, results, and real-world implications.  
- Python scripts and datasets used in the analysis.  
- Plots and outputs demonstrating the conclusions.  

## Current Projects
- [Oxygen Purity Regression](./Oxygen_Purity_Regression)  
  Modeling hydrogen input vs. oxygen purity in a chemical process, with confidence and prediction intervals for decision support.  

- [Regression Through Origin vs. SLR](./RTO_vs_SLR)  
  Comparing model selection strategies using hypothesis tests, with applications in physics, economics, and chemistry.  

## Future Additions
This portfolio is actively growing. Planned areas include:
- Experimental design and ANOVA  
- Logistic regression and classification problems  
- Time series forecasting  
- Simulation studies and resampling methods  
- Applications in economics, engineering, and business analytics  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Regression modeling (linear, logistic, and variations)  
- Hypothesis testing and statistical inference  
- Confidence and prediction interval estimation  
- Simulation and Monte Carlo methods  
- Data visualization and reporting  
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib)
